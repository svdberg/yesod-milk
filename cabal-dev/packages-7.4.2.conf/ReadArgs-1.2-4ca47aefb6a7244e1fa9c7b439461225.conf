synopsis: Simple command line argument parsing
description: ReadArgs provides the @readArgs@ IO action, which lets you tell the compiler
             to parse the command line arguments to fit the type signature you give.
             .
             For example @(a :: Int, b :: String, c :: Float) <- readArgs@ would
             parse the first runtime argument as an @Int@, the second as a @String@ (no
             quotes required) and the third as a @Float@.
             .
             If the runtime arguments are incompatible with the type signature,
             then a simple usage statement is given of the types needed.
             .
             Continuing the previous example, if it was used in a
             program named @Example@, the error message for the above
             action would be:
             .
             @
             usage: Example Int String Float
             @
             .
             Any type that has both @Typeable@ and @Read@ instances
             can be used. @Char@, @String@, and @Text@ are handled specially so that
             command line arguments for both do not require quotes (as their
             @Read@ instances do). A special instance is provided for @FilePath@ so
             that no constructor or quotes are required.
             .
             @readArgs@ also supports optional arguments and variadic arguments.
             Optional arguments are specified using @Maybe@, and variadic arguments
             using a list.  @(a :: Int, b :: Maybe String, c :: [Float]) <- readArgs@
             would successfully parse any of the following sets of command line arguments:
             .
             @
             Example 1
             Example 1 2 3 4
             Example 1 foo
             Example 1 foo 2 3 4
             @
             .
             But not
             .
             @
             Example
             Example foo
             Example 1.0
             @
             .
             Usage statements for optional and variadic arguments use command-line
             parlance:
             .
             @
             usage: Example Int [String] [Float..]
             @
             .
             Note that both optional and variadic parsers are greedy by default
             (so @Example 1 2 3 4@ was parsed as @(1, "2", [3.0,4.0])@.  They
             may both be made non-greedy through use of the @NonGreedy@ constructor:
             .
             @
             ( a :: Int
             , NonGreedy b :: NonGreedy Maybe String
             , NonGreedy c :: NonGreedy [] Float
             ) <- readArgs
             @
